python script for json rpc on battlefield.com

If you just want to test it fill in the email, password, and personaID then run the script. Data is returned in JSON form. Should work for anyone's stats if you have their personaID but at the moment I don't see any way to look people up by name.

It would be best to use this in conjunction with a database instead of fetching the same data over and over.
